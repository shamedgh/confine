<h1>Confine Installation Guide</h1>
<p>
Confine has been mainly developed in python. You need to install the packages
described in the following section and initialize the repository before using
the tool set.
</p>

<div class="tab"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></div>
<div class="tabcontent">
<p>This project has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and it requires Linux kernel v4.15. 
Due to usage of specific
debian-based tools (such as dpkg and apt-file) use on other operating systems
at your own risk.
All the scripts have been written in coordinance with python version 3.7.
</p>

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.7
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo apt install -y sysdig
</pre>

<p>
In case your system does not have the python3.7 in the default repositories, you
may need to add them through third party PPAs separately.
<br/>
An example is provided below:
</p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.7
</pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">NOTE: Adding untrusted PPAs to your system repository is not advised. It can lead 
to the installation of malicious applications. Use third party PPAs at your own risk.</span>
<br/>

In case enabling the docker service fails due to the following error:
</p>
<pre class="tryit_output">
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.service is masked</pre>

<p>
You can run the following command before starting and enabling the service.
</p>

<pre>
sudo systemctl unmask docker.service</pre>
